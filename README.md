**About This Project**

This project was made through the Scrimba frontend path. This uses only CSS and HTML for the layout and styling of the page. None of the buttons are intended to do anything when clicked, as well as the chatbox and burger menu. There is the cursor property for an effect. Photos should scale to size, and there should always be spacing between the caption and button from one another, as well at the top and bottom between photos. If you have any questions, input, or tips for improvement, please feel free to message me on Discord @nyxvixen or email me at noctorvusnyx@gmail.com
